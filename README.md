After cloning the repository, go to the api directory and do the following.
	-Run npm install
	-Run npm install -g pm2
	-Run pm2 start index.js
By default it will run on localhost on port 3000.
If you want to change its port, you should edit the .env file and add: PORT = whatever port you want it to run on.

	-user registration
	-file upload
	-generation of metadata
	-getting list of all files for a user
	-getting a single file for a user
	-file download
	-posting user review
